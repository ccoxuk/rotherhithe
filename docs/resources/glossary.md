## Glossary of Terms

**Technical and Legal Terms Explained**

**Acoustic Treatment**: Materials or design features that control sound (absorption, diffusion, reflection) to improve speech intelligibility or musical quality.

**Asset Protection Agreement**: Formal contract with Network Rail governing any construction or activity within 10m of operational railway, ensuring works do not compromise safety.

**Bearing Capacity**: Maximum load that ground can support without failure; determined by geotechnical survey; critical for foundation design.

**Building Regulations**: UK statutory requirements for building design and construction covering structural integrity, fire safety, accessibility, energy efficiency; enforced by local authority Building Control.

**Community Interest Company (CIC)**: UK legal structure for social enterprises; limited company with asset lock preventing private profit extraction; lighter regulation than charity.

**Completion Certificate**: Official document from Building Control confirming building complies with Building Regulations; legally required before occupation.

**Conservation Area**: Geographic zone designated for special architectural or historic character; additional planning controls apply to preserve character.

**Construction Phase Plan**: Document required under CDM Regulations detailing how construction will be safely executed, including risk assessments and method statements.

**Contingency (Budget)**: Additional funds (typically 10-20% of project cost) held in reserve for unforeseen costs or variations.

**Critical Path**: Sequence of project tasks that determines minimum duration; any delay to critical path tasks delays entire project.

**Decibel (dB)**: Unit measuring sound intensity; logarithmic scale (80dB is 10× louder than 70dB, not 10% louder); UK planning typically uses dB(A) (A-weighted, approximating human hearing).

**Demountable**: Designed to be assembled and disassembled without destruction; allows reuse or relocation; critical for "temporary" classification.

**Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS)**: UK system for checking criminal records; required for anyone working with children or vulnerable adults; three levels (Basic, Standard, Enhanced).

**Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)**: Formal assessment of project's environmental effects; required for certain large developments; unlikely for small theatre projects unless in sensitive location.

**Feasibility Study**: Preliminary investigation assessing whether project is viable (technically, financially, legally); output is recommendation to proceed or not.

**Float (Project Management)**: Amount of time a task can delay without affecting overall project completion; tasks with zero float are on critical path.

**F10 Notification**: Form submitted to Health & Safety Executive notifying them of construction project meeting certain thresholds (CDM Regulations requirement).

**Go/No-Go Decision**: Formal decision point (typically end of Discovery Phase) where project sponsor decides whether to commit to Implementation based on evidence gathered.

**Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR)**: Non-invasive survey technique using radio waves to detect buried objects (utilities, foundations); supplements statutory utility records.

**Health and Safety File**: Document required under CDM Regulations providing information about building/structure for future maintenance, alteration, or demolition; given to client at project completion.

**Imposed Load**: Weight of movable items (people, furniture, equipment) on structure; distinct from dead load (weight of structure itself); UK Building Regulations specify minimum imposed loads for different occupancies.

**Leq (Equivalent Continuous Sound Level)**: Average sound level over a time period; commonly used metric in noise assessments; e.g., "Leq 60dB(A) over 1 hour" means average noise was 60 decibels.

**Licensable Activities**: Activities requiring a licence under the Licensing Act 2003: sale of alcohol, regulated entertainment, late-night refreshment.

**Listed Building**: Structure of special architectural or historic interest; protected by law; alterations require Listed Building Consent; three grades (I, II*, II) reflecting significance.

**Lmax**: Maximum instantaneous sound level during measurement period; used alongside Leq to show peak noise events (e.g., train pass-by).

**Meanwhile Use**: Temporary occupation of land or building awaiting long-term use; often low-rent arrangements benefiting both owner (property maintained, rates reduced) and occupier (affordable space).

**Means of Escape**: Routes people can use to exit building/venue in emergency; Building Regulations specify maximum travel distances and minimum widths.

**Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)**: Non-binding agreement outlining terms of collaboration; lighter than formal contract; common in early partnerships.

**Piled Foundation**: Deep foundation using driven or drilled piles (columns) to transfer load to stable ground below weak surface soils; more expensive than shallow foundations but sometimes necessary.

**Premises Licence**: Licence authorising specific premises to conduct licensable activities; granted by local authority licensing committee; valid indefinitely (subject to conditions compliance).

**Pre-Application Consultation (Pre-App)**: Optional service where developer pays council planning department for informal advice before submitting formal application; strongly recommended for complex projects.

**Principal Contractor**: Role under CDM Regulations; contractor responsible for site safety during construction, coordinating all trades and workers.

**Principal Designer**: Role under CDM Regulations; designer (usually architect or engineer) responsible for coordinating design-stage health and safety, preparing pre-construction information.

**Rateable Value**: Assessed rental value of property used to calculate business rates (property tax); also determines some fee scales (e.g., licensing fees).

**Registered Proprietor**: Legal owner of land as shown on Land Registry title; may be freehold owner or leaseholder.

**Restrictive Covenant**: Legal restriction on land use recorded on title register; e.g., "no building over two storeys" or "maintain access for neighbouring property."

**Risk Score**: Product of likelihood and impact in risk assessment; used to prioritise risks (higher score = more attention needed).

**Scaffold (Tube and Fitting)**: Modular temporary structure using standard steel tubes connected with couplers; versatile and widely used in construction and events.

**Scheduled Monument**: Archaeological site protected under Ancient Monuments Act; requires Scheduled Monument Consent for any work; Brunel Tunnel infrastructure has this status.

**Section 106 Agreement**: Legal agreement attached to planning permission requiring developer to provide community benefits or mitigate impacts; named after Section 106 of Town and Country Planning Act 1990.

**Social Value**: Non-financial benefit to society (employment, skills, health, environment); increasingly factored into funding decisions and procurement.

**Sole Plate (Scaffold)**: Timber plank placed under scaffold base plate to distribute load across wider area; prevents sinking into soft ground.

**Structural Calculations**: Engineering analysis proving structure can safely carry loads; required by Building Control; must be certified by Chartered Structural Engineer.

**Sui Generis**: Latin: "of its own kind"; planning use class for unique uses not fitting standard categories; often applied to theatres, venues, etc.

**Temporary Event Notice (TEN)**: Permit allowing licensable activities for up to 168 hours (7 days) for up to 499 people; simpler and cheaper than Premises Licence but limited number per year.

**Topographical Survey**: Precise measurement of site levels and features; produces accurate drawings used for design and planning applications; conducted by Chartered Land Surveyor.

**Travel Distance**: Distance person must travel from any point in building to reach place of safety; Building Regulations set maximum travel distances based on occupancy and fire risk.

**Use Class**: Planning categorization of land/building use; determines whether planning permission needed for change of use; UK system revised in 2020.
