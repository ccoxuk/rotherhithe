## Toolkit & Templates (Appendix 13.25)
The Manual includes a set of practical templates and checklists that you can copy, adapt or print as required. These are intended to be reused during Discovery and Implementation. A small static site is included in the project and can be built with Docker (see `README_SITE.md`).
- Appendix 13.8: Funder report template
- Appendix 13.9: Health & Safety checklists (performance days)
- Appendix 13.10: Closure & Handback checklist
- Appendix 13.11: Rail Safety Addendum
- Appendix 13.12: GDPR & DPA guidance
- Appendix 13.13: Accessibility & Inclusion checklist
- Appendix 13.14: Director's Core Playbooks (7-Day & 30/90 Day)
- Appendix 13.15: RACI & Decision Log
- Appendix 13.16: Statutory milestone & procurement triggers
- Appendix 13.18: Budget Sensitivity tables
- Appendix 13.20: Procurement & Tender evaluation checklist
- Appendix 13.21: Sample MoU
- Appendix 13.22: Sample DPA clauses

- Printable & downloads
- If using this document as a static PDF: extract the relevant appendix pages and print as a single-sheet checklist.
-- For repositories: create a `toolkit/` folder with the individual templates (MoU, DPA, Partner Contact Form, Daily H&S, Tender scoring matrix) and link them into each Appendix. When using a repo, mark each file as `-sample` to avoid accidental reuse as a final legal form.
- Toolkit location (example): `/Users/craig/Downloads/toolkit` (move into repo root before publishing).
- Note: When moving the toolkit into a Git repository, avoid committing personal data or signed MoUs containing personal info. Store sensitive documents in a secure location and add them to `.gitignore` if needed.
