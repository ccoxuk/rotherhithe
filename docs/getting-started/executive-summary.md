### 1. Strategic Purpose
This manual provides a rigorous, end-to-end governance and delivery framework for establishing temporary or permanent theatre venues in complex urban environments. It is specifically calibrated for **railway-adjacent sites** in Rotherhithe, Southeast London, but its methodology is applicable to any high-constraint capital arts project.

It transforms the "artistic vision" of a venue into a **bankable, insurable, and legally compliant project structure**. It is designed to satisfy the due diligence requirements of:
*   **Statutory Bodies:** Local Planning Authorities, Health & Safety Executive, Network Rail.
*   **Funders:** Arts Council England, NLHF, Social Investors.
*   **Oversight:** Boards of Trustees, Steering Groups, Insurers.

### 2. Core Methodology
The manual enforces a **Three-Phase Project Lifecycle** (Discovery → Implementation → Closure) to control risk and capital exposure.
*   **Discovery:** Low-cost, high-intellect phase to validate feasibility before significant spend.
*   **Implementation:** Rigorous project management of the build, licensing, and operation.
*   **Closure:** Structured demobilisation to protect reputation and capture learning.

### 3. Risk and Governance Profile
This is not merely a "how-to" guide; it is a **risk management system**.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Explicitly addresses CDM 2015, Licensing Act 2003, and GDPR.
*   **Operational Safety:** Mandates specific protocols for railway proximity (Asset Protection).
*   **Financial Control:** Requires sensitivity analysis and contingency planning (Low/Likely/High).

### 4. Intended Audience and Usage
*   **Executive Leadership (Board/Directors):** Use Part One and Part Three to establish governance and strategy.
*   **Project Managers/Producers:** Use Part Two and Part Four (Templates) for daily execution.
*   **Technical/Site Managers:** Use Appendix 13.5 (Risk), 13.9 (H&S), and 13.11 (Rail) for operational safety.

**Critical Note:** This document constitutes **guidance**, not professional advice. All technical, legal, and safety decisions must be ratified by qualified professionals (Structural Engineers, Solicitors, Principal Designers) appointed to the specific project.
