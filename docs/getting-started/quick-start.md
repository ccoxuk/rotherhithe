## Quick Start Playbook — First 7 Days (Director)

**Strategic Purpose: Building Momentum While Establishing Foundations**

The first week of any project sets the tone. Theatre professionals know this instinctively from rehearsals—the opening days establish working culture, trust, and momentum. Venue development is no different.

This playbook compresses critical Discovery Phase activities into seven focused days. It won't complete Discovery (that takes 3-6 months), but it will:

✔ **Establish legal foundations** (entity, insurance, basic contracts)
✔ **Engage critical authorities** (planning, Network Rail, TfL, fire service)
✔ **Commission essential surveys** (structural, topographical, contamination)
✔ **Build stakeholder relationships** (councillors, funders, community groups)
✔ **Create financial reality check** (indicative budget, funding gap analysis)
✔ **Set governance framework** (decision-making, risk management, communications)

**Who Should Use This:**
Project directors, producers, or artistic leads initiating a venue development project. Assumes you have already identified a potential site and secured initial seed funding or board commitment to explore feasibility.

**What Comes Next:**
After completing this playbook, transition to the [30/90 Day Action Playbook (Appendix 13.14)](#appendix-13-14) for comprehensive Discovery Phase completion.

## Quick Start Playbook — First 7 Days (Director)

**Purpose: Maximise Impact in the Critical First Week**

The first seven days set the tone for your entire project. This playbook ensures you make the essential decisions and initiate the critical actions that prevent delays later.

**Golden Thread:** Early actions in Week 1 determine your critical path timeline. Land registry delays, survey scheduling, and pre-app queues can each add 2-6 weeks. Front-load this work now.

**Critical Path (Red = Must Complete):**
- 🔴 Day 1: Land Registry search (blocks all site-specific work)
- 🔴 Day 2: Boundary plan creation (needed for pre-app and APA enquiry)
- 🔴 Day 2: TfL/Network Rail initial contact (long lead time for response)
- 🔴 Day 7: Board authorization (unlocks spending for Week 2+)

**Parallel Opportunities:**
- Days 3-4: Technical surveys can be quoted while awaiting regulatory responses
- Days 5-6: Financial modeling can proceed using assumptions pending survey data
- Days 6-7: Stakeholder outreach begins while technical work progresses

### Day-by-Day Action Checklist

#### **Day 1: Establish Legal Foundations**

**Morning (2-3 hours):**
- [ ] **Land Registry search** – Identify legal owner, boundaries, restrictive covenants
  - Visit: [gov.uk/search-property-information-land-registry](https://www.gov.uk/search-property-information-land-registry)
  - Cost: £3-7 per title; results within 24-48 hours
  - Save PDF to project folder: `/Legal/Land_Registry_[Site_Name]_[Date].pdf`

- [ ] **Note any restrictive covenants or easements** that could affect development
- [ ] **Create site boundary plan** (redline drawing showing your proposed use area)
  - Use Google Maps satellite view as base; mark boundaries in red
  - This is critical for all subsequent applications

**Afternoon (2-3 hours):**
- [ ] **Initial site photos** – Photograph site from multiple angles, include:
  - Boundaries and access points
  - Railway boundary (if adjacent)
  - Neighboring properties
  - Existing structures or constraints
  - Date-stamp all images (camera metadata or photo editing tool)

- [ ] **Create project folder structure:**
  ```text
  [Project_Name]/
  ├── Legal/
  ├── Technical_Surveys/
  ├── Planning_Building_Control/
  ├── Health_Safety/
  ├── Financial/
  ├── Community_Engagement/
  └── Communications/
  ```

**Output:** Land ownership confirmed, site documented, folder structure ready.

**Engagement Strategy by Quadrant:**

| Quadrant | Strategy | Frequency | Method | Key Principle |
|:---------|:---------|:---------:|:-------|:--------------|
| **Manage Closely**<br/>(High Power, High Interest) | Active partnership; co-create solutions; regular two-way dialogue | Weekly-Monthly | Face-to-face meetings, working groups, joint planning | "Nothing about us without us" |
| **Keep Satisfied**<br/>(High Power, Low Interest) | Meet their requirements; avoid surprising them; formal compliance | Quarterly or as required | Formal notifications, compliance reports | "Stay on their radar positively" |
| **Keep Informed**<br/>(Low Power, High Interest) | Provide information; invite participation; acknowledge concerns | Monthly | Newsletters, open meetings, social media | "Build supporters and advocates" |
| **Monitor**<br/>(Low Power, Low Interest) | General communications; minimal active effort | Ad-hoc | Website, public notices, press releases | "Inform but don't burden" |

**Stakeholder Movement:** Positions can shift! A community group (Keep Informed) can move to Manage Closely if they mobilize opposition. Monitor the matrix monthly.
