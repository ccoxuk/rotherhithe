## Appendix 13.12 — Data Protection (GDPR) & Privacy Pack

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: LEGAL COMPLIANCE]**
**Data Protection is not an administrative task; it is a statutory obligation.**
Failure to comply with the UK GDPR and Data Protection Act 2018 can result in:
- Fines of up to £17.5m or 4% of global turnover.
- Reputational destruction (loss of trust from audience and funders).
- Personal liability for Directors in cases of negligence.

**The "Golden Rule":** If you do not need the data, do not collect it. If you collect it, you must protect it.

This section summarises the minimum steps required to comply with data protection obligations relevant to ticketing, volunteers, staff and incident records.

1. Roles and responsibilities
- Data Controller: the legal organisation that holds ticket sales and fundraising income (usually the CIC or charity)
- Data Processor(s): box office provider, online ticketing service, volunteer management platform

2. Minimum documentation
- Data Processing Agreement (DPA) with any ticketing or box-office provider
- Privacy Notice (public-facing) that warns what data you collect, why, retention and how to exercise rights
- Data Retention Schedule: ticketing records for financial audit – 7 years (standard for accounts); incident logs for 3–6 years depending on legal/regulatory guidance
- Data breach response plan with named Data Protection Lead, steps to notify ICO within 72 hours if there's a personal data breach

3. Sample Ticketing Privacy Notice (summary) — insert on ticketing platform
> We collect your name and email to provide tickets and send event information. We process your data as part of our contractual relations with you to deliver the event. We store your data securely, retain ticketing data for 7 years for audit purposes, and never share your data with third parties for marketing unless you provide explicit consent. To exercise any rights (access/delete), contact [Data Protection lead email].

4. Vendor DPA checklist
- Ensure processor detail (sub-processors), security measures (encryption at rest/in transit), delete policy and breach notification clauses, UK/EU cross-border transfer compliance

5. Sample DPA checklist / required clauses
- Processor details: list sub-processors, name/address, jurisdiction
- Purpose & scope: scope of processing and what data fields are shared
- Security: minimum security standards (encryption, MFA for access), audit rights
- Deletion/return: stipulate data deletion or return at contract end and minimum retention limits
- Data subject rights: how processor supports data subject access, rectification or deletion
- Sub-processors: permission/notification clause for further sub-processors
- Breach notification: timelines and support for breach response and forensic support
- Liability & indemnities: limitations of liability and responsibilities for data incidents

6. Data breach incident procedure
- Contain and assess scope of breach; isolate affected systems
- Notify Data Protection Lead and any affected vendors
- Notify ICO within 72 hours if breach is likely to result in a risk to people's rights and freedoms
- Inform affected individuals where there is a high risk to their rights
