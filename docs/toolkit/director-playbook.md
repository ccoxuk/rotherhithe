## Appendix 13.14 — Director's 30 / 90 Day Action Playbook

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: EXECUTIVE ACCOUNTABILITY]**
**The Director is responsible for the pace and momentum of the project.**
Delay is the enemy of temporary projects.
**Focus:** Do not get lost in artistic detail before the site is secured.

30 Day (Discovery Fast Start)
- Week 1: Land registry check; initial site reconnaissance; contact TfL/Network Rail & Southwark pre-app; basic budget check (ordnance survey, estimated costs)
- Week 2: Commission topographical survey and GPR; brief a heritage/spec survey if in conservation area; liaise with neighbours; begin community mapping
- Week 3–4: Pre-app submission to Southwark; appoint a consultant team for costing (QS), H&S, and accessibility if affordable; apply for small feasibility grants if needed

90 Day (Discovery completion)
- Month 2: Complete feasibility: high-level capital & operating model, funding strategy, initial community consultation
- Month 3: Decision: Go/No-Go based on feasibility; board expectation to sign off Discovery outputs and accept risk register

This Playbook checklist is intended for the non-technical Director to help make urgent, high-leverage decisions in a timeline sensitive environment.
