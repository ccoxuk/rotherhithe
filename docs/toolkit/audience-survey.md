### 13.6 Audience Survey Template

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: DATA AS ASSET]**
**Audience data is your most valuable long-term asset.**
Without it, you cannot prove demand to future funders.
**Compliance:** You must have a lawful basis for collecting this data (see Appendix 13.12).

**Purpose:** Gather quantitative and qualitative feedback from audiences to support evaluation, funder reporting, and future programming decisions.

**When to Use:** Distribute surveys at the end of each performance or via email post-event. Aim for a 30-40% response rate by incentivising completion (e.g., prize draw entry).

**Key Metrics to Capture:**
- Demographic data (age, postcode, ethnicity—optional)
- How they heard about the event
- Overall satisfaction rating
- Likelihood to recommend (Net Promoter Score)
- What worked well / what could improve
- Interest in future events

**Data Protection Note:** Ensure survey includes privacy notice and GDPR-compliant data handling. See [Appendix 13.12](#appendix-13-12) for privacy notice template.
