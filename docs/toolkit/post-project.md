## Appendix 13.17 — Post-Project Evaluation Template

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: INSTITUTIONAL MEMORY]**
**A project without an evaluation is a wasted learning opportunity.**
Do not hide failures. Funders respect honest analysis of what went wrong more than a "glossy" report that claims perfection.
**Key Principle:** Evaluate against *original aims*, not just *final outcomes*.

1. Executive Summary (Key outcomes vs planned)
2. Performance against objectives: community engagement, audience numbers, financials
3. Health & Safety: incidents, near-misses, improvements made
4. Environmental & site restoration outcomes (before/after photos, utility close-offs)
5. Financial reconciliation and explanations of key variances
6. Lessons learned and recommendations for future projects
7. Archive and handover materials (where stored, who is responsible)
