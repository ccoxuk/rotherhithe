### 13.5 Risk Assessment Framework & Register Template

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: PROJECT INTELLIGENCE]**
**Risk assessment isn't bureaucratic box-ticking—it's your project intelligence system.**
A well-maintained risk register identifies threats early (when they're cheap to mitigate).
**Board Assurance:** The Board should review the top 5 risks at every meeting.

**Strategic Purpose: Risk Management as Project Intelligence**

Risk assessment isn't bureaucratic box-ticking—it's your project intelligence system. A well-maintained risk register identifies threats early (when they're cheap to mitigate), tracks emerging issues, and provides evidence of due diligence for funders, insurers, and the board.

**The Golden Thread:** Risks identified in Discovery inform design decisions in Implementation and operational procedures during performance runs. Your risk register is a living document that evolves with the project.

**Legal Context:**
- **CDM Regulations 2015:** Require risk assessment during design and construction
- **Health and Safety at Work Act 1974:** Employer duty to assess workplace risks
- **Management of Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999:** Mandate written risk assessments for 5+ employees

**When to Use:**
- **Discovery Phase:** Initial risk identification and site hazard assessment
- **Implementation Phase:** Update as design develops and construction begins
- **Operations:** Daily/weekly review; immediate update after incidents
- **Closure Phase:** Final review and lessons learned documentation

#### Risk Assessment Methodology

**Step 1: Identify Hazards**

Systematically identify anything that could cause harm:
- **Physical hazards:** Railway proximity, working at height, confined spaces, utilities
- **Environmental hazards:** Weather, flooding, ground conditions, noise
- **Operational hazards:** Crowd management, fire, power failure, structural failure
- **Health hazards:** Dust, fumes, manual handling, stress
- **Security hazards:** Trespass, theft, vandalism, terrorism
- **Reputational hazards:** Negative media, community opposition, funder withdrawal

**Step 2: Assess Likelihood and Impact**

| Likelihood (L) | Description | Probability |
|:--------------|:------------|:-----------|
| 1 - Very Unlikely | Has never happened; extremely rare circumstances required | <5% |
| 2 - Unlikely | Could happen but uncommon; specific circumstances required | 5-25% |
| 3 - Possible | Might happen; has occurred elsewhere in similar contexts | 25-50% |
| 4 - Likely | Will probably happen; common occurrence in this type of project | 50-75% |
| 5 - Very Likely | Expected to happen; almost certain without mitigation | >75% |

| Impact (I) | Description | Consequence |
|:----------|:------------|:------------|
| 1 - Negligible | Minor inconvenience; no injury; <£500 cost | Easily absorbed |
| 2 - Minor | First aid injury; minor delay; £500-£5k cost | Manageable within contingency |
| 3 - Moderate | Medical treatment injury; significant delay; £5k-£20k cost | Requires senior management action |
| 4 - Major | Serious injury; major delay/cancellation; £20k-£100k cost | Threatens project viability |
| 5 - Catastrophic | Fatality; project failure; >£100k cost; permanent reputation damage | Project-ending consequence |

**Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact**

| Score Range | Risk Level | Response |
|:-----------:|:-----------|:---------|
| 1-5 | 🟢 **Low** | Monitor; accept risk; standard controls adequate |
| 6-12 | 🟡 **Medium** | Active management; mitigation plan required; regular review |
| 13-25 | 🔴 **High** | Urgent action; senior management oversight; may be project-critical |

**Project:** [Name]  
**Assessment Date:** [Date]  
**Assessor:** [Name, Role]  
**Review Frequency:** Weekly during operations; monthly during Discovery/Implementation  
**Next Review:** [Date]

| Risk ID | Hazard Description | L | I | Score | Risk Level | Existing Controls | Residual Risk | Additional Mitigation | Owner | Status | Review Date |
|:-------:|:-------------------|:-:|:-:|:-----:|:-----------|:------------------|:--------------|:---------------------|:------|:-------|:------------|
| R001 | Railway trespass—public access to live tracks | 3 | 5 | 15 | 🔴 High | Site fencing, signage | 🟡 Medium | 2.4m palisade fence, CCTV, steward patrols, induction briefings | Site Manager | Open | Weekly |
| R002 | Working at height—scaffold erection/strike | 4 | 4 | 16 | 🔴 High | Trained scaffolders, harnesses | 🟢 Low | Scaffold inspection cert, edge protection, exclusion zone | Principal Contractor | Open | Daily during works |
| R003 | Adverse weather—wind >40mph cancels performance | 4 | 3 | 12 | 🟡 Medium | Weather monitoring, contingency plan | 🟢 Low | Tie-down system rated 50mph, Met Office alerts, cancellation protocol | Producer | Open | Daily |
| R004 | Planning permission refused | 2 | 5 | 10 | 🟡 Medium | Pre-app consultation, professional architect | 🟢 Low | Community consultation, councillor engagement, design quality | Director | Closed (approved) | N/A |
| R005 | Contractor insolvency mid-build | 2 | 4 | 8 | 🟡 Medium | Financial vetting, staged payments | 🟢 Low | Parent company guarantee, retention clauses, alternative suppliers identified | Finance Lead | Open | Monthly |
| R006 | Insufficient ticket sales—revenue shortfall | 3 | 3 | 9 | 🟡 Medium | Marketing plan, early booking incentives | 🟡 Medium | Press campaign, partnerships with local groups, dynamic pricing | Marketing Lead | Open | Weekly |
| R007 | Fire—temporary structure highly combustible | 2 | 5 | 10 | 🟡 Medium | Fire-rated materials, extinguishers | 🟢 Low | Fire marshal, evacuation drills, hot work permits, no smoking policy | Site Manager | Open | Daily |
| R008 | Asset Protection Agreement delayed/refused | 3 | 5 | 15 | 🔴 High | Early engagement with Network Rail | 🟡 Medium | Enhanced safety design, specialist consultant, alternative site options | Director | Open | Fortnightly |
| R009 | Noise complaints—breaching licence conditions | 3 | 3 | 9 | 🟡 Medium | Acoustic assessment, sound limits | 🟢 Low | Monitoring equipment, neighbour liaison, performance scheduling | Producer | Open | Weekly |
| R010 | Audience injury—trip hazard in darkness | 3 | 4 | 12 | 🟡 Medium | Lighting, walkway markings | 🟢 Low | Increased lighting levels, steward briefing, first aider on-site | FOH Manager | Open | Daily |

**Risk Score Legend:**
- **L** = Likelihood (1-5)
- **I** = Impact (1-5)  
- **Score** = L × I
- **Residual Risk** = Risk level after existing controls applied

**Overall Project Risk Rating:** 🟡 **Medium** (manageable with controls in place)

**Red Flags (Immediate Escalation Required):**
- Any risk scoring 20-25 (very high)
- Multiple high risks (13-19) in the same category
- Residual risk still high after mitigation
- New risks emerging faster than mitigation can address

#### Risk Response Strategies

| Strategy | When to Use | Example |
|:---------|:------------|:--------|
| **Avoid** | Risk too high; eliminate activity | Don't build within 3m of live railway if APA impossible |
| **Reduce** | Implement controls to lower likelihood or impact | Install 2.4m fence + CCTV to reduce trespass likelihood |
| **Transfer** | Share risk with third party (insurance, contract) | Professional indemnity insurance for designer errors |
| **Accept** | Risk low enough to tolerate; monitor only | Accept minor weather-related delays as normal |

#### Risk Register Maintenance

**Discovery Phase:**
- Initial assessment by H&S consultant and project team
- Site walkover to identify physical hazards
- Stakeholder interviews (identify reputational/relationship risks)
- Review every 2 weeks; update as surveys/reports received

**Implementation Phase:**
- Principal Designer adds construction-specific risks
- Principal Contractor owns site safety risks
- Producer monitors schedule/budget/relationship risks  
- Review weekly at project meetings
- Update immediately after any incident or near-miss

**Operations (Performance Run):**
- Site Manager completes daily review (new risks? controls working?)
- Producer reviews weekly
- Board briefed monthly with top 5 risks
- Immediate escalation for any high-risk events

**Closure Phase:**
- Final review captures lessons learned
- Document "what worked" and "what we'd do differently"
- Archive for future projects
