## Appendix 13.23 — Building a Simple Critical Path / GANTT Template

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: THE MYTH OF THE PERFECT PLAN]**
**A schedule is a living document, not a wall chart.**
If you do not update it weekly, it is useless.
**Critical Path:** Identify the tasks that *must* happen on time (e.g., Planning Permission, APA). If these slip, the opening night slips.

Purpose: Provide a short, practical GANTT template for Discovery → Implementation → Closure showing critical statutory milestones and dependencies.

Columns to include in spreadsheet:
- Task Name
- Owner (RACI)
- Start Date
- End Date
- Duration (calculated)
- Dependencies (comma separated)
- Status (Not started / In progress / Complete)
- Notes (link to documents, permit IDs)

Key tasks to include in the template:
1. Discovery tasks: surveys, land registry, pre-app submissions, APA enquiries
2. Permissions: planning submission, consultation, building control
3. Statutory approvals: Asset Protection Agreement, Permits
4. Enabling works: temporary works install, safety checks
5. Commissioning & occupancy: test events, inspections, opening

Usage: build the template in a spreadsheet (Excel/Google Sheets); share with funders and board as the single source of truth and update weekly.
