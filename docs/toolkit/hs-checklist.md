### 13.9 Health & Safety Checklist for Performance Days

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: NON-NEGOTIABLE SAFETY]**
**Safety is the only thing that can close you down instantly.**
The Site Manager has absolute authority to stop the show if safety is compromised.
**Board Duty:** The Board must be assured that this checklist is being completed *daily*.

**The Golden Thread: Safety as Non-Negotiable Foundation**

Health and safety is not bureaucratic box-ticking—it is the ethical and legal foundation upon which everything else rests. For railway-adjacent sites, this becomes even more critical. The daily operational checklist below provides a systematic framework for maintaining safety standards throughout the performance run.

**Integration Point:** This checklist should be used in conjunction with the [Risk Register (Appendix 13.5)](#appendix-13-5-risk-assessment) and the [Rail Safety Addendum (Appendix 13.11)](#appendix-13-11). Daily observations feed into weekly risk reviews.

**Accountability:** The Site Manager owns daily checklist completion; the Producer reviews and escalates urgent issues; the Board receives weekly safety summaries.
