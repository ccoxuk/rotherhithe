## Appendix 13.13 – Accessibility & Inclusion Checklist

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: BEYOND COMPLIANCE]**
**Accessibility is not just about ramps; it is about welcome.**
Meeting the Equality Act is the *minimum* legal standard, not the target.
**Risk:** Exclusionary practices can lead to reputational damage and loss of public funding.

This checklist is to ensure the venue meets Equality Act and good practice expectations. It is not a substitute for detailed design by an accessibility consultant, but it is a practical working template for the delivery team.

1. Access routes and entrances
- Clear step-free route to an accessible entrance with ramp gradient <1:12 where required
- Arrival signage and pick-up/drop-off space considered for accessible transport

2. Internal circulation
- Minimum clear width of 900mm on routes used by audiences/staff
- Tactile and high-contrast signage on level changes and exits
- Escape routes designed with refuges where stairs are present

3. Seating and viewing
- Minimum accessible platform (wheelchair) positions with companion seats for each block of audience
- Clear sightlines from accessible positions

4. Ticketing and FOH
- Accessible booking option online and via phone
- Front-of-house training to support disabled people
- Quiet/sensory rooms for patrons with sensory needs

5. Facilities
- At least one accessible toilet with adult-sized changing table or tracking hoist if required by the audience profile

6. Communications
- Hearing loop or infra-red system where possible; clear pre-performance PA messages for audiences with sensory impairment
- Provide a 'relaxed performance' variant where appropriate and document adjustments

7. Monitoring and reporting
- Include an Accessibility section in the daily checklist and post-show monitoring
- Engage local access groups during Discovery and record accessibility requirements in the project Health & Safety plan

### Stewarding, FOH & Minimum Ratios
- Recommended stewarding ratio for unseated/outdoor events: 1 steward per 50 audience members for standard sites; for rail adjacent or high-risk sites use 1 steward per 30.
- Minimum of one trained first-aider on site and one steward trained in basic evacuation and fire marshal duties per performance.
- All stewards should receive a pre-shift briefing covering crowd dynamics, evacuation routes, railway boundary protocols, and communications plan.
- For rail-adjacent sites, bolstered stewarding at vulnerable touchpoints (gates, track-facing boundaries) is recommended—consider dedicated track-boundary watchers during set-up/pack-down.
