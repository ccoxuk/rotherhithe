## Appendix 13.20 — Procurement & Tender Evaluation Checklist (Short)

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: PUBLIC MONEY]**
**Procurement is about defensibility, not just price.**
If you are spending grant money, you must be able to prove you achieved value for money.
**Audit Trail:** Keep every quote, email, and decision log. You may be audited 5 years from now.

1. Procurement policy and small-works approach
- For small orders (<£10k): 1-2 quotes preferred; public sector orgs may require 3 quotes for transparency.
- For works between £10k–£75k: gather 3 written quotes and ensure contractor competence checks (insurance, references, H&S records).
- For >£75k: tender process with written selection criteria, PSQs and interview where appropriate.

2. Tender evaluation matrix
- Include criteria such as: Cost (40%), Experience & References (25%), H&S & Competence (15%), Social & Local Value (10%), Delivery Timescale (10%).
- Use a simple scoring out of 10 per criterion; multiply by weight to produce overall score.

3. Minimum pre-qualification checklist
- Insurance (Public Liability ≥ £5m), Employer’s Liability, Works-specific certification, CSCS for staff, DBS where appropriate, references, and evidence of craft competence.

4. Local supplier development
- Where local capacity is limited, consider bundling smaller suppliers into a single contract or using an aggregator.
