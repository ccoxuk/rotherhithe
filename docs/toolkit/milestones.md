## Appendix 13.16 — Statutory Milestones & Critical Path Template (Short)

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: REALISM]**
**Statutory bodies do not care about your opening night.**
Planning and Asset Protection timelines are fixed. You must fit your artistic programme around them, not vice versa.

Sample milestone order (adjust on site specifics)
1. Discovery complete (landowner contact, surveys, pre-app) — no works
2. Pre-planning engagement and statutory consultations (including Network Rail / TfL) — enables planning submission
3. Planning submission & negotiation — expect 8–16 weeks (with potential extensions)
4. Building Control & CDM pre-construction information — required before works begin
5. Asset Protection Agreement (Network Rail & TfL) — required for works within 10m of track
6. Contractor mobilisation and temporary works install — only after Building Control sign-off and APA
7. Testing/commissioning and final sign-offs — before opening and occupation

### Procurement, Commitments and Contracting Triggers
- Do not place irrevocable orders for critical temporary works and structural kit until Building Control approval and Asset Protection Agreement are in place. 
- For high-value items (>£25k) or long-lead-time equipment (scaffold, piled foundations), condition orders on receipt of formal permissions and a signed APA if works affect track works.
- Avoid prefunding or pre-purchasing more than 40% of kit value before final planning sign-off, unless you have specific pre-approved variation controls and a funding buffer.
- Use short lead-time 'option to buy' or supplier hold agreements where possible to reserve availability without committing funds prematurely.
