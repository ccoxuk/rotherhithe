### 13.8 Funder Report Template

**Strategic Context: Funders as Partners, Not Just Paymasters**

**[GOOD PRACTICE]**
Funder reporting is often seen as an administrative burden. Reframe it: this is your opportunity to demonstrate impact, build trust, and strengthen relationships for future applications. A well-crafted funder report tells your project's story with evidence, honesty, and learning.

**The Golden Thread:** Effective funder reporting connects what you promised (application), what you delivered (outputs), what you learned (evaluation), and what comes next (sustainability). Each section below serves this narrative arc.

**Customisation Guidance:** Tailor the depth of each section to the grant value and any bespoke reporting clauses in your funding agreement. Small grants (£5k-£20k) may require 3-5 pages; major grants (£100k+) may require 20-30 pages with appendices.

**Cross-Reference:** Use data from the [Audience Survey (13.6)](#appendix-13-6-audience-survey), [Risk Register (13.5)](#appendix-13-5-risk-assessment), [Budget Template (13.18)](#appendix-13-18), and [Partnership Log (13.19)](#appendix-13-19) to populate this report efficiently.

#### Template Structure

##### Cover Information
- Organisation name, project name, grant reference
- Recipient (funder name) and reporting period
- Submission date and primary contact (name, email, phone)

##### Executive Summary (one page)
- Brief project overview
- Key achievements
- Headline challenges and mitigation
- Outcomes and impact snapshot
- Financial topline (income vs expenditure)

##### Section 1 – Project Delivery
[Summary of what was delivered vs what was promised]

##### Section 2 – Programme & Deliverables

**Programme Overview:**
Provide a comprehensive overview of the programme delivered against the original project schedule. Highlight any changes to timing, scope, or delivery methods, and explain the strategic or operational reasons for these adjustments.

**Deliverables Breakdown:**
List what was delivered with specific metrics:
- Number of performances (vs. planned)
- Audience numbers (total and per performance)
- Community workshops or engagement sessions
- Physical infrastructure created
- Digital outputs (if applicable)
- Partnership activations

**Comparison to Planned Milestones:**
Use a simple table to show planned vs. actual delivery:

| Deliverable | Planned | Actual | Variance | Explanation |
|:------------|:--------|:-------|:---------|:------------|
| Performances | 12 | 14 | +2 | Additional dates added due to demand |
| Audience | 720 | 840 | +120 | Higher capacity achieved |
| Workshops | 6 | 5 | -1 | Facilitator illness; rescheduled to next phase |
- Timings: a short narrative and a table showing original vs actual dates for key milestones (Discovery completion; planning consent; temporary works installation; first performance; closure).


##### Section 3 – Community Engagement & Participation
- Summary of community engagement undertaken (events, workshops, leaflets, consultation submissions) and outcomes.
- Community benefits delivered (local hires, reduced ticket prices, free performances, space usage) and number of local beneficiaries.
- Key partners and local groups engaged; any formal agreements or MoUs.
- Any concerns raised and how they were addressed; lessons learned for future community engagement.

##### Section 4 – Evaluation and Learning
###### 4.1 What Worked Well
- [Successes to replicate]

###### 4.2 What Was Challenging
- [Honest reflection: What was harder than expected?]

###### 4.3 How We Responded
- [Adaptations made during project]

See toolkit/funder-report-template-full.md for a downloadable funder report template and example structure.

###### 4.4 Lessons for Future
- [What would we do differently?]
- [Recommendations for others attempting similar projects]

##### Section 5 – Financial Report

**The Golden Thread: Financial Transparency Builds Trust**

**[GOOD PRACTICE]**
Funders need to see that their investment was managed prudently. Present variances honestly with clear explanations. Significant underspend can be as concerning as overspend—both suggest planning gaps.
