## Appendix 13.24 — Action Plan for Legal Review (Priority List)

**[GOVERNANCE NOTE: PROFESSIONAL INDEMNITY]**
**You are not a lawyer.**
Do not draft your own contracts for high-risk activities.
**Cost Benefit:** A £500 legal review now can save £50,000 in litigation later.

Use this short checklist to instruct solicitors and specialist counsel on priority items to review before any contract or high-value decision is executed.
- APA/Asset Protection Agreement (Network Rail / TfL): Review for conditions, liability and fee structure.
- DPA & ticketing processor agreements: Ensure appropriate security, breach process and deletion/retention policy.
- MoU with landowner: Check for any hidden covenants or liabilities on the title.
- Insurances: Confirm levels and types of required insurance for contractors and volunteers.
- Trade contracts for high-value suppliers: standard T&Cs and performance KPIs.


**Value Engineering**: Process of reviewing design to reduce costs without compromising essential function or safety; distinct from corner-cutting.

**Wayfinding**: Design of signage, landmarks, and spatial cues helping people navigate environment; critical for promenade theatre where audience moves through space.
