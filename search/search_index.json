Cross-references will guide you to related sections as needed.</p> <p>3.

determined by geotechnical survey; critical for foundation design.</p> <p>Building Regulations: UK statutory requirements for building design and construction covering structural integrity, fire safety, accessibility, energy efficiency; enforced by local authority Building Control.</p> <p>Community Interest Company (CIC): UK legal structure for social enterprises; limited company with asset lock preventing private profit extraction; lighter regulation than charity.</p> <p>Completion Certificate: Official document from Building Control confirming building complies with Building Regulations; legally required before occupation.</p> <p>Conservation Area: Geographic zone designated for special architectural or historic character; additional planning controls apply to preserve character.</p> <p>Construction Phase Plan: Document required under CDM Regulations detailing how construction will be safely executed, including risk assessments and method statements.</p> <p>Contingency (Budget): Additional funds (typically 10-20% of project cost) held in reserve for unforeseen costs or variations.</p> <p>Critical Path: Sequence of project tasks that determines minimum duration; any delay to critical path tasks delays entire project.</p> <p>Decibel (dB): Unit measuring sound intensity; logarithmic scale (80dB is 10\u00d7 louder than 70dB, not 10% louder); UK planning typically uses dB(A) (A-weighted, approximating human hearing).</p> <p>Demountable: Designed to be assembled and disassembled without destruction; allows reuse or relocation; critical for \"temporary\" classification.</p> <p>Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS): UK system for checking criminal records; required for anyone working with children or vulnerable adults; three levels (Basic, Standard, Enhanced).</p> <p>Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA): Formal assessment of project's environmental effects; required for certain large developments; unlikely for small theatre projects unless in sensitive location.</p> <p>Feasibility Study: Preliminary investigation assessing whether project is viable (technically, financially, legally); output is recommendation to proceed or not.</p> <p>Float (Project Management): Amount of time a task can delay without affecting overall project completion; tasks with zero float are on critical path.</p> <p>F10 Notification: Form submitted to Health &amp; Safety Executive notifying them of construction project meeting certain thresholds (CDM Regulations requirement).</p> <p>Go/No-Go Decision: Formal decision point (typically end of Discovery Phase) where project sponsor decides whether to commit to Implementation based on evidence gathered.</p> <p>Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR): Non-invasive survey technique using radio waves to detect buried objects (utilities, foundations); supplements statutory utility records.</p> <p>Health and Safety File: Document required under CDM Regulations providing information about building/structure for future maintenance, alteration, or demolition; given to client at project completion.</p> <p>Imposed Load: Weight of movable items (people, furniture, equipment) on structure; distinct from dead load (weight of structure itself); UK Building Regulations specify minimum imposed loads for different occupancies.</p> <p>Leq (Equivalent Continuous Sound Level): Average sound level over a time period; commonly used metric in noise assessments; e.g., \"Leq 60dB(A) over 1 hour\" means average noise was 60 decibels.</p> <p>Licensable Activities: Activities requiring a licence under the Licensing Act 2003: sale of alcohol, regulated entertainment, late-night refreshment.</p> <p>Listed Building: Structure of special architectural or historic interest; protected by law; alterations require Listed Building Consent; three grades (I, II*, II) reflecting significance.</p> <p>Lmax: Maximum instantaneous sound level during measurement period; used alongside Leq to show peak noise events (e.g., train pass-by).</p> <p>Meanwhile Use: Temporary occupation of land or building awaiting long-term use; often low-rent arrangements benefiting both owner (property maintained, rates reduced) and occupier (affordable space).</p> <p>Means of Escape: Routes people can use to exit building/venue in emergency; Building Regulations specify maximum travel distances and minimum widths.</p> <p>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU): Non-binding agreement outlining terms of collaboration; lighter than formal contract; common in early partnerships.</p> <p>Piled Foundation: Deep foundation using driven or drilled piles (columns) to transfer load to stable ground below weak surface soils; more expensive than shallow foundations but sometimes necessary.</p> <p>Premises Licence: Licence authorising specific premises to conduct licensable activities; granted by local authority licensing committee; valid indefinitely (subject to conditions compliance).</p> <p>Pre-Application Consultation (Pre-App): Optional service where developer pays council planning department for informal advice before submitting formal application; strongly recommended for complex projects.</p> <p>Principal Contractor: Role under CDM Regulations; contractor responsible for site safety during construction, coordinating all trades and workers.</p> <p>Principal Designer: Role under CDM Regulations; designer (usually architect or engineer) responsible for coordinating design-stage health and safety, preparing pre-construction information.</p> <p>Rateable Value: Assessed rental value of property used to calculate business rates (property tax); also determines some fee scales (e.g., licensing fees).</p> <p>Registered Proprietor: Legal owner of land as shown on Land Registry title; may be freehold owner or leaseholder.</p> <p>Restrictive Covenant: Legal restriction on land use recorded on title register; e.g., \"no building over two storeys\" or \"maintain access for neighbouring property.\"</p> <p>Risk Score: Product of likelihood and impact in risk assessment; used to prioritise risks (higher score = more attention needed).</p> <p>Scaffold (Tube and Fitting): Modular temporary structure using standard steel tubes connected with couplers; versatile and widely used in construction and events.</p> <p>Scheduled Monument: Archaeological site protected under Ancient Monuments Act; requires Scheduled Monument Consent for any work; Brunel Tunnel infrastructure has this status.</p> <p>Section 106 Agreement: Legal agreement attached to planning permission requiring developer to provide community benefits or mitigate impacts; named after Section 106 of Town and Country Planning Act 1990.</p> <p>Social Value: Non-financial benefit to society (employment, skills, health, environment); increasingly factored into funding decisions and procurement.</p> <p>Sole Plate (Scaffold): Timber plank placed under scaffold base plate to distribute load across wider area; prevents sinking into soft ground.</p> <p>Structural Calculations: Engineering analysis proving structure can safely carry loads; required by Building Control; must be certified by Chartered Structural Engineer.</p> <p>Sui Generis: Latin: \"of its own kind\"; planning use class for unique uses not fitting standard categories; often applied to theatres, venues, etc.</p> <p>Temporary Event Notice (TEN): Permit allowing licensable activities for up to 168 hours (7 days) for up to 499 people; simpler and cheaper than Premises Licence but limited number per year.</p> <p>Topographical Survey: Precise measurement of site levels and features; produces accurate drawings used for design and planning applications; conducted by Chartered Land Surveyor.</p> <p>Travel Distance: Distance person must travel from any point in building to reach place of safety; Building Regulations set maximum travel distances based on occupancy and fire risk.</p> <p>Use Class: Planning categorization of land/building use; determines whether planning permission needed for change of use; UK system revised in 2020.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"specialist/finance/","title":"3.4 Finance","text":"<ol> <li>Financial Management</li> <li>Budget Development &amp;
